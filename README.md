A Raspberry Pi script for recording RPICam or webcam files over a long time frame.

I created this script so that it would record video using a Raspberry Pi and could record for a long period of time. I only had access to RPi 3B+ models, and I was worried that it would not be able to save large video files quickly enough. Therefore, I set this up to only record video for a length of one minute. I found that it could save and start recording the next file easily.

I had this recording continuously for over 30 days. Unfortunately, I found out that this created close to 40,000 individual files, which upset most computers when I tried to open the USB hard drive I had saved these to. To combat this, I set up a system where it will record 600 files into its own folder and then repeats this process. This then enables easy access to the files without giving your computer a minor heart attack.

You can change the video quality and frame rate at your leisure. It does save files as .h264 files, which is apparently preferred by the Raspberry Pi. These are easily converted using another one of my repositories.


Enjoy!
